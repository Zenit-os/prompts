You will be given a piece of code that needs refactoring. Your task is to generate a comprehensive prompt that offers multiple refactoring approaches for this code.

<code>
{{CODE}}
</code>

<refactoring_goals>
{{refactoring_goals}}
</refactoring_goals>

Your goal is to create a refactoring prompt that:
- Analyzes the current code and identifies areas for improvement
- Provides at least 2 different refactoring solutions/approaches
- Creates simple step-by-step lists for implementing each solution
- Explains the benefits and trade-offs of each approach

When generating your refactoring solutions, consider common improvement areas such as:
- Code readability and clarity
- Performance optimization
- Maintainability and modularity
- Following best practices and design patterns
- Reducing code duplication
- Improving error handling
- Enhancing testability

For each solution you propose:
1. Give it a clear, descriptive title
2. Provide a brief explanation of the approach
3. List the specific steps needed to implement the refactoring
4. Mention the key benefits of this approach
5. Note any potential drawbacks or considerations

Structure your response as a complete refactoring prompt that could be given to a developer. Include an introduction that explains what the original code does and why it needs refactoring, followed by your multiple solution approaches.

Your final response should be formatted as a ready-to-use refactoring prompt inside <refactoring_prompt> tags. Make sure each solution includes a numbered step-by-step implementation list that is easy to follow.
